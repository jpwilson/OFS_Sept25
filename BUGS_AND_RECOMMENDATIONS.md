## Bugs & Issues

### 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY

#### 1. Missing API Endpoint: User Events
**Issue:** No endpoint to get events for a specific user
**Expected:** `GET /api/v1/users/{username}/events`
**Current:** Endpoint does not exist
**Impact:** Profile pages must fetch all 101 events and filter client-side
**Severity:** Medium
**Status:** Missing Feature

**Workaround:**
- Frontend currently fetches all events with `GET /api/v1/events`
- Filters by `author_username` client-side
- Works but not optimal for performance with large datasets

**Recommendation:**
Add endpoint to `/backend/app/api/users.py`:
```python
@router.get("/{username}/events")
def get_user_events(
    username: str,
    db: Session = Depends(get_db)
):
    user = db.query(User).filter(User.username == username).first()
    if not user:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="User not found")

    events = db.query(Event).filter(
        Event.author_id == user.id,
        Event.is_published == True
    ).order_by(Event.created_at.desc()).all()

    return events
```

**Estimated Time to Fix:** 30 minutes

---

### 🟢 LOW PRIORITY

#### 2. Missing Server-Side Filtering
**Issue:** No API support for date range or followed user filtering
**Expected:**
- `GET /api/v1/events?start_date=2024-01-01&end_date=2024-12-31`
- `GET /api/v1/events?author_ids=1,2,3`

**Current:** All filtering done client-side
**Impact:**
- All 101 events loaded even when filtering
- Not scalable for large datasets
- Extra bandwidth usage

**Severity:** Low
**Status:** Performance Optimization

**Workaround:**
- Frontend filters work correctly
- Acceptable for current dataset size

**Recommendation:**
Add query parameters to events endpoint:
```python
@router.get("", response_model=List[EventResponse])
def get_events(
    skip: int = 0,
    limit: int = 100,
    start_date: Optional[str] = None,
    end_date: Optional[str] = None,
    author_ids: Optional[str] = None,
    db: Session = Depends(get_db)
):
    query = db.query(Event).filter(Event.is_published == True)

    if start_date:
        query = query.filter(Event.start_date >= start_date)
    if end_date:
        query = query.filter(Event.start_date <= end_date)
    if author_ids:
        ids = [int(id) for id in author_ids.split(',')]
        query = query.filter(Event.author_id.in_(ids))

    events = query.order_by(Event.created_at.desc()).offset(skip).limit(limit).all()
    return events
```

**Estimated Time to Fix:** 1 hour

---

#### 3. Follow Count Discrepancy
**Issue:** Database has 94 follows instead of expected 95
**Expected:** 95 follow relationships
**Actual:** 94 follow relationships
**Impact:** None - acceptable variance
**Severity:** Minimal
**Status:** Data Discrepancy

**Recommendation:**
- Not critical - 1 follow difference is acceptable
- If exact count needed, reseed database with `python3 reset_and_seed.py`
- Likely due to seed data randomization

**Estimated Time to Fix:** N/A (not a bug)

---

#### 4. CORS Configuration
**Issue:** Frontend runs on port 3001 but CORS only allows 3000 and 5173
**Current Settings:**
```python
allow_origins=["http://localhost:5173", "http://localhost:3000"]
```
**Impact:** May cause CORS errors if frontend runs on different port
**Severity:** Low
**Status:** Configuration Issue

**Recommendation:**
Update CORS settings in `/backend/app/main.py`:
```python
app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=["http://localhost:5173", "http://localhost:3000", "http://localhost:3001"],
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)
```

**Estimated Time to Fix:** 2 minutes
