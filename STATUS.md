## üéØ Recommended Next Steps (In Order)

### Option A: Build MVP End-to-End (Recommended)
1. **Backend auth** - Register, login, JWT tokens
2. **Frontend auth** - Login page, auth context, protected routes
3. **Events API** - Create, read, list events (no content blocks yet)
4. **Feed integration** - Connect feed to real API
5. **Event detail page** - Show full event
6. **Event creation** - Basic form (title, dates, location, cover image)
7. **Image upload** - Backend + frontend
8. **Content blocks** - Add images and text to events
9. **Test full flow** - User can create event with images, view on feed

### Option B: Focus on Event Detail First
1. Build out Event Detail page with mock data
2. Perfect the magazine-style layout
3. Then connect to backend

### Option C: Backend First
1. Complete all backend API routes
2. Test with API client (Postman)
3. Then build frontend features
