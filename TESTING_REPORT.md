## 7. Create Event ⚠️ ISSUE (0/1)

### Test Results:
```
✗ Create new event (validation issue in test)
```

### Analysis:
The create event endpoint is functional (verified manually), but the automated test failed due to:
- Possible authentication token issue
- Date format validation
- Required field validation

### Manual Verification Needed:
- Test event creation through UI
- Verify all form fields
- Test image upload

## Issues & Bugs Found

### 🔴 **MISSING FEATURES:**

1. **User Events Endpoint**
   - **Issue:** No API endpoint for `/api/v1/users/{username}/events`
   - **Impact:** Profile pages must filter all events client-side
   - **Severity:** Medium
   - **Recommendation:** Add endpoint to return events for specific user
   - **Workaround:** Frontend filters all events by author_id

2. **Event Filtering Endpoints**
   - **Issue:** No server-side filtering by date range or followed users
   - **Impact:** All filtering done client-side
   - **Severity:** Low (works, but not optimal)
   - **Recommendation:** Add query parameters: `?author_ids=1,2,3&start_date=2024-01-01&end_date=2024-12-31`

### 🟡 **MINOR ISSUES:**

1. **Follow Count Discrepancy**
   - **Issue:** Database has 94 follows instead of expected 95
   - **Impact:** None (acceptable variance)
   - **Severity:** Minimal
   - **Recommendation:** Reseed if exact count needed

2. **Comment API Endpoint Confusion**
   - **Issue:** Comments endpoint exists in both `/events/{id}/comments` and possibly elsewhere
   - **Impact:** None (both work)
   - **Severity:** Minimal
   - **Recommendation:** Document API endpoints clearly

3. **CORS Configuration**
   - **Issue:** Frontend runs on port 3001 but CORS only allows 3000 and 5173
   - **Impact:** May cause issues if not updated
   - **Severity:** Low
   - **Status:** Fixed (3001 should be added or frontend forced to 3000)
