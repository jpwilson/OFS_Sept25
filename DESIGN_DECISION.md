# Design Decision

## Selected Design: Mockup 5 - Photo Focus

### Design Characteristics
- **Dark theme as default** (with light mode option to be added)
- **Immersive, photo-first approach**
- Large, full-bleed images that dominate the viewport
- Text overlays on images for feed items
- Minimal UI that fades into the background
- Full-width hero images on detail pages
- Clean, modern typography
- Content-focused with maximum impact

### Key Features to Implement
1. **Dark Mode** (default, as shown)
2. **Light Mode** (to be designed and implemented)
3. **Responsive design** across mobile, tablet, desktop
4. **Photo-centric layout** with overlay text
5. **Immersive event detail pages** with inline photos
6. **Minimal chrome** - let content shine

### Design Philosophy
- Photos are the hero
- UI should be invisible/unobtrusive
- Maximum visual impact
- Magazine-quality presentation
- Seamless reading experience

### Next Steps
1. Design light mode variant
2. Build out full component library based on this aesthetic
3. Create responsive breakpoints
4. Implement theme switching
5. Build actual React components (not just mockups)
6. Design remaining pages (profile, creation, stats)
7. Set up backend architecture
